# Stats roadmap

#### Motivation

## ðŸ“š Books

[Practical Regression and Anova using R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Faraway-PRA.pdf): If you ever wonder how to do a regression fit step by step using R by hand, then this is the place to go. It also explain all parts of the output summary and how each one is calculated.

[The hundred page machine learning book](http://themlbook.com/wiki/doku.php): A beautifully crafted book with python examples and a friendly introduction on the mathematics behind lots of algorithms. It also takes you to the work flow of problem solving.

<u>Machine Learning: A probabilistic perspective by Kevin Patrick Murphy</u>: Amazing book that starts with stats and probability concept. Requires high knowledge on math and related concepts. A good book to start, stop and come back from time to time to realize that you understand more that the previous time.

[Forecasting: Principles and Practice](https://otexts.com/fpp2/): A comprehensive introduction to forecasting methods using R.

[The elements of statistical learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/): A masterpiece that soon or later one has to read. Above the level of hundred-page machine learning but below Machine learning by Murphy.

#### Chapters

[Essentials of Clinical Research](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/297114700_Essentials_of_Clinical_Research): Most of the chapters are fully available on research-gate.

- [Chapter 17](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226733813_Bias_Confounding_and_Effect_Modification) - Bias, Confounding, and Effect Modification: A good place to start when trying to learn these concepts.
- [Chapter 18](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225876931_It's_All_About_Uncertainty) - It's all about uncertainty:  This chapter is aimed at providing the foundation for common sense issues that underlie why and what statistics is.

[Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/)

- [Chapter 25](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/missing.pdf) - Missing data imputation: Types of missing values and different imputing models to deal with them.

## ðŸ“„ Articles

#### Count data

[Visualizing count data using rootograms](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.01311.pdf): Rootograms are an awesome tool for visualizing the under/over-dispersion phenomena seen in Poisson and Negative Binomial models for count data.

[Regression models for count data in R](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v027i08/v27i08.pdf): A revision of the most common used models for count data using R. 

#### Hurdle models

[Gettin started with hurdle models](https://data.library.virginia.edu/getting-started-with-hurdle-models/): Step by step introduction for fitting and assessing hurdle models using R.

[Interpreting hurdle models](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stata/output/zero-inflated-poisson-regression/): Reading the output of hurdle models by using STATA output as an example.

#### Gradient boosting

[How to explain gradient boosting by Parr and Howard](https://explained.ai/gradient-boosting/index.html): A very concise guide made up of 3 parts that works as an introduction for learning GB fundamentals. Math notation is involved when explaining the models, but doesn't go to deep on it.

#### Generalized Estimating Equation

[Dependent samples from STAT 504](https://newonlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat504/node/94/)

#### Hypothesis testing

[Tutorial on Fisher's exact test](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/polopoly_fs/1.43998!/file/tutorial-9-fishers.pdf):

## Videos & Courses

[Policy Analysis Using interrupted Time Series](https://www.edx.org/course/policy-analysis-using-interrupted-time-ubcx-itsx-2): Edx course on how to perform interrupted time series and regression discontinuity design.

[Causal Diagrams: Draw your assumptions before your conclusions](https://www.edx.org/course/causal-diagrams-draw-assumptions-harvardx-ph559x): Learn to use direct acyclic graphs for drawing causal inference. Helpful for identifying and illustrating the presence of confounders, mediators and colliders.

[Amazon machine learning course for data scientists](https://aws.amazon.com/training/learning-paths/machine-learning/data-scientist/): A must do course that introduce in a comprehensive manner the fundamentals math behind regression, specifically MLE.

#### Youtube

[StatQuest with Josh Starmer](https://www.youtube.com/user/joshstarmer/videos): A video series explaining multiple stats concepts in a simple light but in a thorough way.

[JBStatistics](https://www.youtube.com/user/jbstatistics/videos): Multiple concepts explained by problem solving.

[CRISP-DM: The dominant process for data mining](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=civLio11SjQ): A step by step guide on cross-industry standard process for data mining. CRISP-DM is a guideline that helps data scientist to structure the problems in a business framework and make solutions more communicable for the target public.

[Stata learner](https://www.youtube.com/user/ashwinikalantri/playlists): An HarvardX course that was previously feature in EdX. Deals mostly with theoretical aspects of experimental design and how to perform data analysis using STATA. Those looking for an introduction to experimental design, should give a shot to this video series.
