# Stats road-map

Hi, I'm a junior data scientist coming from clinical research. I've gained experience with experimental design, causal inference and basic statistical analysis while becoming a physician at Buenos Aires University. I've always being inclined towards epidemiology and statistics, gaining a profound love of stats and math as an adult. It was only a matter of time before I found out about data science and machine learning. From then on, I haven't stop reading, watching lectures, programming and practicing with datasets. Coming from a field outside computer science or statistics gave me a different approach on learning the needed skills, but also a different set of problems to solve on my way. Because of this, I decided to keep a record of all materials that helped me achieve those 'eureka' moments. I hope this list helps you too, feel free to push changes or ideas!

## Books

[The hundred page machine learning book](http://themlbook.com/wiki/doku.php): A beautifully crafted book with python examples and a friendly introduction on the mathematics behind lots of algorithms. It also takes you to the work flow of problem solving in ML.

[An introduction to statistical learning with applications in R](https://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ISLR%20First%20Printing.pdf): A good second step before reading one of the bibles of machine learning.

[The elements of statistical learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/): A masterpiece that soon or later one has to read. Above the level of hundred-page machine learning but below Machine learning by Murphy.

[Machine Learning: A probabilistic perspective](https://doc.lagout.org/science/Artificial%20Intelligence/Machine%20learning/Machine%20Learning_%20A%20Probabilistic%20Perspective%20%5BMurphy%202012-08-24%5D.pdf): Amazing book that starts with stats and probability concept. Requires high knowledge on math and related concepts. A good book to start, stop and come back from time to time to realize that you understand more that the previous time.

[Practical Regression and Anova using R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Faraway-PRA.pdf): If you ever wonder how to do a regression fit step by step by hand, then this is the place to go. It also explain all parts of the output summary and how each one is calculated.
